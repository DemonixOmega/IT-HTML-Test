<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>Before we get started<br />I need to mention a few thingd</p>
<ol>
  <li>I haven't been keeping up with updates for my games<br /> I sincerely apologize for that, not like anyone cares :(</li>
  <li>In my spare time, I have been learning to code webpages, so thats that</li>
  <li>Finally, I am not much into programming games anymore, but I start it again soon<br /> I think...</li>
<ol>
<h2>CratePak<h2>
 <p>Now, let's take some time to explore what I have been working on for 1.5 years</p>
 <p>I have been working on a special System for ABx downloading, to make it<br /> less boring</p>
 <p>It is called CratePak</p>
 <p>The entire System is about 55 pages long!<br /> Make sure to give it at least SOME credit</p>
<h3>What is the point?</h3>
<p>I created this system to make ABx downloading a lot less boring making players receive an "ABx Talisman"<br /> in the system to be eligible to download ABx</p>
<h4>What is in this system?</h4>
<p>This system encases battling Monsters, Marketing(ABx Style), Trading, Forging, Space Travel,<br />Crafting, Exploration, Gathering, Collecting,<br />Auctioning, and much more!</p>
<h5>How can I get this System?<h5>
<p>This system can be received by sending me a request via Email, and posting<br />your Account info in the email.</p>
<p>Info needed: Username, Password, Codename, Guide Download Key</p>
<p>Did I mention that you have to be sent a special download key to download the guide?<br /> No? Well you can get it by doing one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If known friend: Request Download Key
  <li>If Follower on GameJolt: Request Download Key(Must have followed before CratePak Dev.)
  <li>If person of interest: Pass a CratePak Test / Pay $1.00(Keep in mind<br /> its 55 Pages long)
</ul>
